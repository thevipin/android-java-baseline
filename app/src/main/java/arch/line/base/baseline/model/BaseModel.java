 * By default, Room creates a column for each field that's defined in the entity.
 * If an entity has fields that you don't want to persist, you can annotate them using @Ignore.
 * You must reference the entity class through the entities array in the Database class.
 * Caution: Table names in SQLite are case-insensitive.
